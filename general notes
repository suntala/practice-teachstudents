CLA canceling a class —> check number of students there and if there are fewer than half the capacity, cancel the class and send matching student service to each of the people getting canceled

STU get participation grade: hold class and get attendance —> cycle through number of sessions and record the number of times student is there (A for over 90%, B for 80 to 90%, F for the rest)

STU create a remedial class with homework helpers—> gather students who have F into as few tutoring groups as possible (based on their open times)
